### Introduction

The Hibernate Types repository gives you extra types and general purpose utilities that are not supported by the Hibernate ORM core. 

The main advantage of this project is that it supports a broad range of Hibernate versions, spanning from Hibernate 4.1 to Hibernate 5.4.

### Features

#### JSON 

##### Oracle

You should use the `JsonStringType` to map a `VARCHAR2` column type storing JSON.

You should use the `JsonBlobType` to map a `BLOB` column type storing JSON.

For more details, check out [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/oracle-json-jpa-hibernate/).

##### SQL Server

You should use this `JsonStringType` to map an `NVARCHAR` column type storing JSON.

For more details, check out [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/sql-server-json-hibernate/).

##### PostgreSQL

You should use this `JsonBinaryType` to map both `jsonb` and `json` column types.

For more details, check out [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-map-json-objects-using-generic-hibernate-types/).

##### MySQL

You should use this `JsonStringType` to map the `json` column type.

<img src="https://vladmihalcea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hypersistence-Optimizer-300x250.jpg" alt="Hypersistence Optimizer">
</a>

Imagine having a tool that can automatically detect if you are using JPA and Hibernate properly. No more performance issues, no more having to spend countless hours trying to figure out why your application is barely crawling.

Imagine discovering early during the development cycle that you are using suboptimal mappings and entity relationships or that you are missing performance-related settings. 

More, with Hypersistence Optimizer, you can detect all such issues during testing and make sure you don't deploy to production a change that will affect data access layer performance.

[Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hibernatetypes) is the tool you've been long waiting for!

### How to remove the Hypersistence Optimizer banner from the log?

#### Why the Hypersistence Optimizer banner?

Maintaining this project costs thousands of dollars per year, and, without the support of [Hypersistence](https://hypersistence.io/),
this project would have to be abandoned.

> The reason why this banner was added is that, when I enabled GitHub donations, [no one ever donated a single cent](
https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea/status/1194584719133958146) to support this project.

And, spreading the news about the amazing [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/) tool I'm currently building is much more beneficial for the vast majority of Hibernate projects.

#### Adding Hypersistence Optimizer to your project

Using Hibernate without [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/) is highly discouraged, hence the reason for that banner. You can view it as a `WARN` log message that tells you are risking application performance issues if you don't make sure you use the right JPA mappings and Hibernate configuration properties.

> If you want to see why it's a bad idea to use JPA and Hibernate without a tool that inspects your mappings and configurations, check out this [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1nOVct9P2g).

So, the easiest way to have the banner removed is to add [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/) to your project.

### Setting the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false` configuration setting

You can disable the banner by providing the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false` in either `hibernate.properties` or `hibernate-types.properties` file.

If can also provide the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false`setting as a Java System property when bootstrapping your Java application:

    java -Dhibernate.types.print.banner=false -jar target/application-1.0.0.jar
    
#### Will I remove the banner?

I know the banner might be a little annoying. But you know what's even more annoying? Having all those [open issues](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hibernate-types/issues) waiting to be fixed.

So, I decided that I would remove the banner only when the vast majority of the currently opened issues were going to be fixed. If you don't have the time to do it, I totally understand that. I don't have the time to do it either. But, I could be paid to do that, and then, you could all benefit from those new features. I estimated the cost for working on all those issues to be around 25000$. If anyone is willing to sponsor the development of this project, don't hesitate to contact me.

> If you're wondering why that banner was not removed by now, it's because there are still plenty of issues waiting to be fixed, and that's not the true spirit of open-source software development!

##### Should you open a GitHub issue asking me to remove the banner?

Disabling this banner takes very little time, so there is no point in opening a GitHub issue to ask me to remove this banner, 
especially since there's already [a pinned GitHub issue explaining how to remove it](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hibernate-types/issues/196).
 
Keep in mind that all issues related to the banner removal will be deleted because I use the GitHub issue feature for technical features only (e.g., enhancements, bug fixing).

In case you think that the banner is unfair and disabling it is too much of an effort for you, then you can also:

- fork the repository
- remove the banner from the source code
- build the project and use your own banner-free version

This project is _free_ as in [Libre, not Gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre).

## Code of conduct

1. If you don't agree with these Terms and Conditions, you don't have to use the official repository. You are free to fork the repository and manage it as you may wish.
2. Bullying, rudeness, arrogance, or lecturing me about OSS with an utter sense of entitlement are not tolerated and might lead to GitHub account banning.

> The only people entitled to say how open source 'ought' to work are people who run projects, and the scope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.
> 
> Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status, focus and effort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.
> 
> As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all. You are not entitled to contribute. You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others. You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation.
> 
> If you have expectations (of others) that aren't being met, those expectations are your own responsibility. You are responsible for your own needs. If you want things, make them.
> 
> Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software and the right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of 'community-driven-development' are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work, a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things can work and a pervasive sense of communal entitlement.
